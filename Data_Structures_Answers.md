Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` method?
   O(n) because there is no iteration, but the recursion might make it more expensive

2. What is the space complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` function?

    I believe it's O(n)

<!-- 3. What is the runtime complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?

4. What is the space complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method? -->

5. What is the runtime complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?

    Because there are two for loops it makes it O(n^2)

6. What is the space complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?

    O(n) two lists filling the input

7. What is the runtime complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?

    I think it's O(1) but the worst case is O(n) according to https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity

8. What is the space complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?

    O(n) because I used variables to store the input to memory
